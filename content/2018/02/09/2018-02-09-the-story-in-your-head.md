Do you think when Bill Gates was starting Microsoft he thought to himself - "People are going to love the story of starting up this company in a garage"? Not at all - he wasn't worried about the story that was going to be told about him. He wasn't worried about what others thought of him. He was setting his ego aside and *doing the work.*

Set aside the ego - don't tell yourself a story. "I'm going to be the next X" or "this will be great to tell in the future." Taking a picture of the "early days" of a startup for "the future media" - you're already telling yourself a story. Ego is clouding your judgement, ego is preventing you from *doing the work.*

Post inspired from: **Ego is the Enemy** by Ryan Holiday.
