> ### What Is a Patch?
>
> A patch is a specific file that outlines all the changes made between two sets of files. For example, if I have file and I make some changes to it, I would create a patch file that showcases the differences that I have implemented, and then I would submit it so other developers can review and/or implement it. This way, when developers are contributing to Drupal core or contributed modules, they can easily submit patches for any fixes without sending over a completely new file.
