> Our tests used to be built using a tool called[Casper](http://casperjs.org/)that ran on top of a[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/)headless browser. Our experience with Casper has unfortunately been troublesome with tests failing for no apparent reason and inconsistencies across runs. Our tests were becoming so finicky and troublesome that we started commenting out tests that we knew were succeeding in the browser but failed for Casper. We still needed our builds but Casper was not being a reliable source of information for passing and failing tests. This was obviously not a good sign, bad practice, and would lead to trouble down the line.
