My first blog post for Outside. Check out [Code Management and Deployment at Outside.](https://www.outsideonline.com/2295281/code-management-and-deployment-outside)

Excerpt:

> This first post is going to touch on some of the build tools and systems we use to manage our code, our development, and most importantly, our deployment. Outsideâ€™s development cycle is fluid and agile: we can deploy code at any time and have changes and updates visible to our users within minutes. (We avoid merges on Friday afternoons.) With our development cycle, we need to make sure all our code is properly reviewed and tested before we deploy to production.
